# CIFAR-10-Classifier

•   Continuously adjusted the model structure and hyperparameters on Google Colab, ultimately training a residual network with depthwise separable convolution blocks that featured progressively increasing channels and strides, designed for image recognition tasks. This included initializing convolutional layers, four residual layers, and a fully connected layer.
•   The final model had 722,186 parameters, with an accuracy rate of 90.04%.
